Virtuoso from Python
====================

This package is intended to be a collection of modules for 
interacting with `OpenLink Virtuoso`_ from python.

The goal is to provide drivers for `SQLAlchemy` and `RDFLib`.

At the time of this writing it requires a patch for pyodbc
as documented in: http://river.styx.org/ww/2010/10/pyodbc-spasql/index
